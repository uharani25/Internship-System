# Internship-System
This is a project that mainly focuses on practical application of SQL programming language using MySQL Server.

Internship System is a web application that monitors and allows students, faculty and companies to be on the same page i.e. how many students are placed in a particular company, how many students are yet to be placed, etc. I have used HTML, PHP, CSS for the front-end design while the back-end is designed used SQL programming language using MySQL tool.
